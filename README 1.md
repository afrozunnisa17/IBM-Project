Citizen AI – Intelligent Citizen Engagement Platform

📌 About the Project
This project, developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan (NM) program, showcases the use of AI-powered language models to enhance citizen–government interaction. Citizen AI serves as an intelligent assistant that provides accurate, conversational responses to citizen queries through an easy-to-use interface.

The system integrates the IBM Granite AI model (accessed via Hugging Face) to understand user input and generate meaningful, context-aware answers related to governance, public services, and general information. The platform aims to demonstrate how generative AI can transform digital governance and citizen engagement.

✨ Features

🤖 AI-Powered Chat Assistant – Uses IBM Granite LLM to deliver intelligent and human-like responses.

🖥️ Interactive User Interface – Developed using Gradio, offering a simple and engaging way for users to interact with the AI.

☁️ Google Colab Integration – Fully functional in a Colab environment, requiring no additional setup or installations.

📑 Custom Query Handling – Allows citizens to ask personalized questions on government services, schemes, and general topics with real-time AI responses.

🔒 Reliable & Scalable – Demonstrates the potential of secure, cloud-based AI systems for modern e-governance applications.
